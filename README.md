# Uncommon HTML Error: Incorrect innerHTML and Broken Image
This example demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can occur when using innerHTML to insert HTML content into an element.  The issue arises when attempting to insert an image with a non-existent source.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs because `innerHTML` directly parses and inserts HTML content.  However, if the image source (`src`) attribute points to a non-existent file, it will break the image rendering and potentially log an error to the browser console. 

## Solution
To fix this, ensure that all image sources are valid and accessible.  Consider more robust methods for content insertion.
